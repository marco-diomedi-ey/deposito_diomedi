    Multi-stage RAG flow for comprehensive aeronautic question answering.
    
    This CrewAI Flow orchestrates a sophisticated question-answering pipeline that combines
    local knowledge base retrieval, web search capabilities, and document generation.
    The flow includes question validation, dual-source analysis, and result aggregation.
    
    Flow Architecture
    -----------------
    1. **Starting Procedure**: Initialize flow execution
    2. **Question Generation**: Capture user input for aeronautic queries
    3. **Question Analysis**: Validate aeronautic relevance using Azure OpenAI
    4. **RAG Analysis**: Local document-based knowledge retrieval and answer generation
    5. **Web Analysis**: External web search for complementary information
    6. **Result Aggregation**: Combine and synthesize all findings into comprehensive documentation
    7. **Plot Generation**: Visualize the flow execution graph
    
    Crew Integration
    ----------------
    - **AeronauticRagCrew**: Local knowledge base querying with FAISS vector store
    - **WebCrew**: Web search and content analysis using SerperDev API
    - **DocCrew**: Professional markdown document generation and synthesis
    
    State Management
    ----------------
    Uses AeronauticRagState for persistent data flow between stages, enabling
    comprehensive result tracking and aggregation across multiple crew executions.
    
    Routing Logic
    -------------
    Implements intelligent routing based on question relevance:
    - 'success': Question is aeronautic-relevant, proceed with full analysis
    - 'retry': Question lacks aeronautic context, restart question capture
    
    Notes
    -----
    - Requires Azure OpenAI credentials for question validation
    - Integrates with local FAISS knowledge base and external web sources
    - Produces comprehensive markdown documentation with source citations
    - Includes flow visualization capabilities for pipeline monitoring
