- **Input Sanitizer**: Query improvement specialist that enhances and clarifies user queries for optimal processing
- **Output**: Security validation report and sanitized input (`output/security_check.json`, `output/sanitized_query.json`)

#### 3. Analysis Crew
**Purpose**: Comprehensive project analysis and research
**Location**: `src/report_generator/crews/analysis_crew/`

**Components**:
- **Project Analyzer**: Analyzes user queries to extract project details and determine target audience
- **Outline Creator**: Content structure specialist that creates detailed outlines with subpoints based on project analysis
- **Output**: Detailed analysis report and structured outline (`output/project_analysis.json`, `output/detailed_outline.json`)

#### 4. Writer Crew
**Purpose**: Professional report generation and formatting
**Location**: `src/report_generator/crews/writer_crew/`

**Components**:

## Architecture Details

### Data Flow Architecture

The system uses a Pydantic-based state model to maintain data consistency:

```python
class ReportState(BaseModel):
    """Shared state across all crews."""
    user_input: Dict[str, Any]
    sanitized_input: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
    security_check: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
    analysis_result: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
    final_report: Optional[str] = None
```

### Communication Patterns

**Sequential Processing**: Each crew processes the output of the previous crew in a linear fashion.

**State Persistence**: All intermediate results are stored in the shared state for debugging and analysis.

**Error Propagation**: Errors are gracefully handled and propagated through the pipeline with appropriate fallback mechanisms.

### Scalability Considerations

**Horizontal Scaling**:
- Each crew can run on separate machines
- Multiple instances can handle concurrent requests
- Easy conversion to microservices architecture

**Performance Optimization**:
- RAG results and intermediate outputs are cached
- Non-blocking operations where possible
- Efficient handling of large language model operations

## Testing Framework

The Report Generator includes a comprehensive testing and evaluation framework that validates the performance, security, and quality of all three crews. The testing system uses MLflow for experiment tracking and provides both automated and manual testing capabilities.

### Overview

The testing framework consists of three main evaluation modules:

- **Sanitize Crew Evaluation**: Security validation and threat detection testing
- **Analysis Crew Evaluation**: Project analysis quality and relevance assessment  
- **RAG Evaluation**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation performance testing

```

### Custom Test Development

**Creating New Tests**:

```python
# Example: Custom security test
from report_generator.crews.sanitize_crew.sanitize_crew import SanitizeCrew

def test_custom_security_scenario():
    """Test custom security validation scenario."""
    crew = SanitizeCrew()
    
    # Your test input
    test_input = "Your test case here"
    
    # Execute crew
    result = crew.crew().kickoff(inputs={"user_input": test_input})
    
    # Validate results
    assert "APPROVED" in result.raw or "BLOCKED" in result.raw
    
    return result
```

**Adding MLflow Tracking**:

```python
import mlflow

# Start MLflow run
with mlflow.start_run():
    # Log parameters
    mlflow.log_param("test_type", "custom_security")
    
    # Run test
    result = test_custom_security_scenario()
    
    # Log metrics
    mlflow.log_metric("success_rate", 1.0)
    mlflow.log_metric("execution_time", 2.5)
```

### Evaluation Best Practices

1. **Run tests after code changes** to ensure system integrity
2. **Use MLflow UI** to compare performance across experiments
3. **Review detailed output files** for in-depth analysis
4. **Monitor security metrics** especially after prompt modifications
5. **Validate RAG retrieval quality** when updating knowledge base
6. **Test with diverse inputs** to ensure robustness across use cases

### Troubleshooting Tests

**Common Issues**:
